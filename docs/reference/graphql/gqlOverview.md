[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. 
GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

## How to access GraphQL
GraphQL IDEs let you build queries, browse schemas, and test out GraphQL APIs. Some of the most used IDEs are:
 * [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql)
 * [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground)
 
To begin exploring GraphQL, set the GraphQL endpoint by entering https://api.positiveaction.net/graphql in the URL bar of your IDE or extension. 
You can use the browser in the right column to determine how to set up a query or mutation. 
Examples are also available throughout the Positive Action GraphQL documentation.
